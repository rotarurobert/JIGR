            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
A jigsaw puzzle is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of often oddly shaped interlocking and tessellating pieces. Each piece usually has a small part of a picture on it; when complete, a jigsaw puzzle produces a complete picture.

              JIGR is a web application designed to solve puzzles proposed by the program or defined by users. Each player is
            able to select - either locally or remotely via a URL - an image (in PNG and JPEG formats) that will be cropped at runtime into fragments as complicated as possible using rules
            based on generative grammars (rectangular divisions being excluded). The pieces are mixed and the shifts/swings are performed via drag & drop operations. Once a fragment is moved near or almost near to its correct piece, the application provides support for snap placement
            in the right area. The current status of each puzzle can be saved locally with the possibility of subsequent restoration.<br><br>

            <h2>Used technologies</h2>

            <h3>HTML5/CSS3</h3>
            <p>
                <u>Hypertext Markup Language revision 5 (HTML5)</u> is markup language for the structure and presentation of World Wide Web contents. HTML5 supports the traditional HTML and XHTML-style syntax and other new features in its markup, New APIs, XHTML and error handling.
            </p>

            <p>
                <u>CSS3</u> makes changes to how some visual elements are implemented and rendered by a browser. However, it is not a single hugely unwieldy specification, unlike CSS2. CSS3 is separated into separate modules to facilitate development. This means that the specification comes out in chunks, with more stable modules than others.
            </p>

                <h2>Application Architecture</h2>
                <h3>Front-end</h3>
                <p>Built with CSS and HTML, application's interface has four pages, the third one being almost the same as the home page. It is ilustrated by the scheme below:</p>
                <center><img alt="page-one" src="./page-one.png"></center><br><br>
                <center><img alt="page-two" src="./page-two.png"></center><br><br>
                <center><img alt="page-four" src="./page-three.png"></center>

            <section id="hunk-elements">
                <h2>Interaction with users</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Players are welcomed by the home page, where it shows them the option of choosing a default puzzle and redirect them to Playground or go to the next page, 'Upload' to make a puzzle with their own favourite image.</li>
                  <li>Second page has a simple form for upload that also takes the users to Playground page once the picture is submitted.</li>
                  <li>On Search tab, users can scroll through all puzzles or search for a specific one.</li>
                  <li>Playground displays the game, having an easy menu on the right side consisting of below options:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Play - to start the game</li>
                      <li>Preview - to see again the picture that needs to be assembled as orientation for solving</li>
                      <li>Save and resume later</li>
                      <li>Reset - to its initial game state</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>

                <h2>Effective team work with GitHub</h2>
                <p>GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.</p>

                <p>We chose to work with github mainly because it's easy and quick to sync when using desktop version plus, we had the option to track our progress and divide tasks in order to be effective as a team.</p>
